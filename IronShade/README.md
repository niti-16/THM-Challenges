# TryHackMe - IronShade Writeup

## Room Overview

In this room, I investigated a compromised Linux server to identify attacker activity, persistence mechanisms, suspicious services, malicious processes, SSH activity, and installed malware.

The investigation involved:

- Log analysis
- User account analysis
- Persistence hunting
- Process analysis
- Service enumeration
- SSH investigation
- Package investigation

# 1. Identify the Machine ID

Machine IDs uniquely identify a Linux system.

### Command

```bash
cat /etc/machine-id
```

### Answer

```text
dc7c8ac5c09a4bbfaf3d09d399f10d96
```

---

# 2. Identify Suspicious User Creation

A common attacker persistence technique is creating a new user account.

### Command

```bash
cat auth.log | grep -a "useradd"
```

### Output

```text
Aug  5 22:05:33 cybertees useradd[2067]: new user: name=mircoservice
```

### Finding

A suspicious user account was created:

```text
mircoservice
```

---

# 3. Investigate User Activity

After identifying the account, I searched all authentication logs for activity associated with it.

### Command

```bash
grep -a "mircoservice" auth.log*
```

### Findings

#### User Creation

```text
new user: name=mircoservice
```



#### SSH Login

```text
Accepted password for mircoservice from 10.11.75.247
```

#### Root Access

```text
sudo: mircoservice : TTY=pts/1 ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/su
```

```text
session opened for user root by mircoservice(uid=0)
```

---

# Analysis

The attacker:

1. Created a new account
2. Set a password
3. Logged in through SSH
4. Successfully escalated privileges to root

This strongly indicates attacker persistence.

---

# 4. Investigate Cron Persistence

Cron jobs are frequently used to maintain persistence.

### Check User Crontab

```bash
sudo crontab -u mircoservice -l
```

Output:

```text
no crontab for mircoservice
```

### Check Root Crontab

```bash
sudo crontab -u root -l
```

### Finding

```bash
@reboot /home/mircoservice/printer_app
```

---

# Persistence Analysis

The attacker configured a cron job that automatically launches a program whenever the machine boots.

### Persistence Mechanism

```bash
@reboot /home/mircoservice/printer_app
```

### Answer

```text
@reboot /home/mircoservice/printer_app
```

---

# 5. Investigate Running Processes

The cron job pointed to a suspicious binary.

### Command

```bash
ps aux | grep "mircoservice"
```

### Output

```text
root      575  0.0  0.0  /home/mircoservice/.tmp/.strokes
root      885  0.0  0.0  /home/mircoservice/printer_app
```

---

# Analysis

Two suspicious processes were running from the attacker's home directory.

### Suspicious Hidden Process

```text
.strokes
```

### Answer

```text
.strokes
```

### Number of Processes

```text
2
```

---

# 6. Investigate Hidden Files in Memory

The room required identifying a hidden file from the root directory.

### Investigation

Enumeration of hidden files revealed:

```text
.systmd
```

### Answer

```text
.systmd
```

---

# 7. Investigate Suspicious Services

Attackers often install services to survive reboots.

### Enumeration Method

```bash
ls /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/system.slice/
```

and

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
```

### Findings

Two suspicious services were identified:

```text
backup.service
strokes.service
```

### Answer

```text
backup.service, strokes.service
```

---



# 8. Investigate SSH Activity

### Command

```bash
grep -a "mircoservice" auth.log*
```

### Finding

```text
Accepted password for mircoservice from 10.11.75.247
```

### Source IP

```text
10.11.75.247
```

### Answer

```text
10.11.75.247
```

---

# 9. Count Failed SSH Logins

### Command

```bash
grep -a "Failed password" auth.log*
```

### Finding

Multiple failed login attempts were observed against the backdoor account.

### Answer

```text
8
```

---

# Analysis

The attacker successfully authenticated several times but later generated multiple authentication failures.

Possible reasons include:

- Incorrect password entry
- Account modifications
- Failed brute-force attempts
- Operational mistakes by the attacker

---

# 10. Identify Malicious Package

Package investigation revealed a suspicious package.

### Finding

```text
pscanner
```

### Answer

```text
pscanner
```

---

# 11. Recover Secret Code

Metadata analysis of the malicious package revealed a hidden flag.

### Answer

```text
{_tRy_Hack_ME_}
```

---

# Attack Timeline

| Time | Activity |
|--------|--------|
| Aug 5 22:05:33 | User account `mircoservice` created |
| Aug 5 22:05:39 | Password configured |
| Aug 5 22:10:40 | SSH login from attacker IP |
| Aug 5 22:10:40 | Session opened |
| Aug 5 22:14:40 | Privilege escalation to root |
| Aug 5 22:20:57 | Suspicious binary execution |
| Persistence | Root cron launches `printer_app` at boot |
| Persistence | `backup.service` installed |
| Persistence | `strokes.service` installed |
| Runtime | `.strokes` process running |
| Malware | `pscanner` package installed |

# Key Lessons Learned

During this investigation I practiced:

- Linux log analysis
- Authentication log review
- User creation detection
- SSH activity investigation
- Cron persistence hunting
- Process enumeration
- Service enumeration
- Package investigation
- Building an attack timeline
- Identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

This room demonstrates how attackers maintain persistence on Linux systems using user accounts, cron jobs, hidden processes, services, and malicious packages.
